# Hangman
This is the popular word guessing game Hangman! In this game, the player keeps guessing letters until they either run out of guesses or they get the word right!

## Settings
To set the word count, simply enter an integer between 1 and 4 as directed.
To set the difficulty, enter the number 1 or 2 corresponding to easy and hard respectively.

## Playing the game
On your turn, enter a letter, and you will know if your guess was correct or not, as the corresponding letter on the display alphabet will be highlighted either red or green
